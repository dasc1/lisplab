Challenge: zz_script

First of all, we must install Common Lisp:

CLISP / UBUNTU LINUX
====================

CLISP is the Gnu implementation of Common Lisp.  It is available in the
repositories, so you can install it with a simple apt-get command:

  >>> sudo apt-get install clisp

====================

I have saved a file called "helloworld.lisp" in this directory which
prints the string as demanded by the challenge.  You can run the program
by typing at the command line (from this directory):

  >>> clisp helloworld.lisp
